Trigger.io plugin that automagically adds "Rate this app" prompts to your trigger.io application.

Supports iOS and Android.

Uses [AppRate](https://github.com/TimotheeJeannin/AppRate) and [iRate](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate) to make the magic happen.

Once you add this plugin to your trigger.io project, you're all set. No need to invoke or configure it, just uses iRate or AppRate default behaviors.
